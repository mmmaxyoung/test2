One interpretation could be that the airline has never had an accident. However, this is not the case - United Airlines Flight 173 crashed in 1978 after the crew failed to notice that the plane was losing altitude. \n\nAnother interpretation of \"perfect operation record\" could be that the airline has never had any safety incidents. However, this is also not the case - United Airlines Flight 811 had a cargo door blow out in 1989, leading to nine deaths. \n\nSo, based on these two interpretations, we can conclude that United Airlines does not\nTherefore, the answer is",

In this context, \"typical\" could mean \"common\" or \"usual\". \n\nNext, we need to look at whether it was common or usual for Johnny Cash to perform on stage in a rainbow-colored outfit. Unfortunately, this is difficult to determine, as there is no definitive answer. While there are many photos of Johnny Cash performing in a variety of different outfits, it is difficult to say how often he wore rainbow-colored clothing. \n\nIt is possible that Johnny Cash wore rainbow-colored clothing more often than other performers,\nTherefore, the answer is",

So, to answer your question, yes, a person with anorexia nervosa is more likely to break a bone than a regular person.\nTherefore, the answer is",
                "completion": " yes, a person with anorexia nervosa is more likely to break a bone than a regular person."
