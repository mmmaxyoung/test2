If Ed had 17 marbles How many marbles does Doug have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \n\nEd had 12 more marbles than Doug. \nEd lost 20 of his marbles at the playground. \n\nThat means that Doug must have started with 8 fewer marbles than Ed. So if we start with the number of marbles that Ed had after he lost his 20 marbles, we can figure out how many Doug had to start with. \n\nEd had 17 marbles after he lost 20. \n17 - 20 = \nEd had -3 marbles after he lost 20. \n\nThat can't be right, so we'll try something else. \n\nEd\nTherefore, the answer is",
                "completion": " Doug had -3 + 12 = 9 marbles."
